# LightShaker
The LightShaker is a handheld PersistenceOfVision-Display featuring an STM32F0 controller, USB connectivity, 16 RGB LEDs and a 3-axis accelerometer
The Component selection is a tradeoff between easy assembly and price & availablility. The accelerometer is the only component that can't be soldered by hand. It could be omitted, but honestly, that's the coolest feature of it :)

The Lightshaker was designed for electronics events and classes with kids. With a bit of supervision (and the accelerometer preassembled), even beginners can build a really cool gadget. With the provided OpenSource Firmware a fully featured active and even per USB configurable POV display is the first cool Application of the LightShaker. 
But with the RGB-LEDs, USB-connectivity and the accelerometer, lots of other cool things are possible! For Example:
- Joystick, Mouse or customized analog Input device for the PC
- electronic level
- propeller clock
- ...
